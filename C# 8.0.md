## Nullable Reference Types
	This feature is to prevent null reference exceptions and intends to warn you about null-unsafe behavior in the code. 
There are two types 1. non-nullable reference types 2. non-nullable reference types 

### non-nullable reference types 
- A reference is not supposed to be null. 
- When variables aren't supposed to be null, the compiler enforces rules that ensure it is safe to dereference these variables without first checking that it isn't null
- The variable must be initialized to a non-null value.
- The variable can never be assigned the value null.
ex:
`string name = "Kadal"` 

Warning will be issued for the below examples:
Student s = null;

Student s= new Student();
s = null;
Console.Writeline("${s.Name}")

### nullable reference types 
- A reference may be null
- When variables may be null, the compiler enforces following rules to ensure that you've correctly checked for a null reference
- The variable may only be dereferenced when the compiler can guarantee that the value isn't null.
- These variables may be initialized with the default null value and may be assigned the value null in other code.
ex:
`string? name = null` 

To turn the feature on throughout the project add the following line to your .csproj file

``` xml
<NullableReferenceTypes>true</NullableReferenceTypes>
```

To enable/disable nullable reference type feature for single .cs file/line by enabling nullable context.

### Nullable Contexts
Nullable contexts enable fine-grained control for how the compiler interprets reference type. 

The nullable context is controlled using a new pragma:

#nullable enable sets the nullable context to enabled.
#nullable disable sets the nullable context to disabled.
